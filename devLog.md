# The Dev Log
This log contains brief rundowns of meetings our group members had; both as future reference and for when group members couldn't catch a meeting.

### 09/09/2021

### A starting structure of the game
#### Scenes to implement
- Title screen
- One level (populated spawned enemies and environment items)

#### Programming
- Player
    - player movement
    - start with ONE basic attack (make it snappy and fluid)

- Enemy
    - spawn them on the map
    - decide and implement how they aggro (e.g. "wake up" when player is nearby or actively patrolling as soon as the level is loaded)

- Camera angle
    - decide on what type of angle

#### Assets needed
- Player
- Enemy (just one type or 2 or 3?)
- Environment items (e.g. a boulder, a tree...etc)
- Consumables (e.g. potions, food, coins etc)

### Current status
- Need to have a meeting to see if everyone who wants to be involved likes/agrees with the structure shown above
- Currently collecting moodboard to decide the scene of the game
